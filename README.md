the place where I give it a try for the new (I mean for me new) languages

what is melody transposition anyway
===================================

Well, the melody in music have it's notes (scores), from first to last, and
each have it's value. The transposition of melody is the process of changing
every note equally for the same interval. Let's say we have a melody of only
three notes, C, D, F and we want it to transpose for one full note up; this
will give us D, E, G. Simple enough, but the magic really occurs with the
same C, D, F transposed for two notes up, it became E, F#, A.

The magic goes away if we'll think in 12 tones instead of just 8. Let's
imagine piano's keyboard: 

    .C# D# F# G#A#
    ||_|_|||_|_|_||
    | | | | | | | |
    |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
     C D E F G A B

Yes, this is 8 notes in octave, but counting with black keys we see our
full chromatic 12-notation. It is really simple. Instead of thinking
'we transpose from C to D by one note' think instead 'we transpose from
C to D by two semitones'
